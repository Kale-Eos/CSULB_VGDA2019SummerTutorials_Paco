# CSULB_VGDA2019SummerTutorials_Paco
This repository is recording of the Intermediate Tutorial Series completed over CSULB VGDA's Unity summer workshop in 2019.

The workshop was directed by California State University, Long Beach's Video Game Development Association (CSULB VGDA).
The current President as of June 2019, **Alex Pinedo**, and General Officer, **Grayson Hill**, oversaw the progress and provided support and guidance to fomulating the direction for the course.

All code and game development was based on a multitude of series completed by Paco Ellaga and links will be periodically updated for reference.  This workshop was completed utilizing the Unity game engine across various updated versions, also while using C# scripting.
